# Allow exit.target to start even if this unit is started with replace-irreversibly.
# All (weak) dependencies need to do the same. Services also need to ensure they
# are in the root slice by setting Slice=-.slice.

# can not stop dbus here, use dde-fake-session-exit-task.service
# Conflicts=dbus.service
# After=dbus.service

# We need to make sure this unit is stopped; primarily so that the tree of
# units that we created is completely cleaned.
# Note that this can also be improved by reversing the conflicts above and
# not listing them in the shutdown unit.
